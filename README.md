# CycleGAN

This repository implements a **CycleGAN** framework for unpaired image-to-image translation between horses and zebras. The model learns to translate images of horses to zebras and vice versa, without requiring paired training data.  

---

## Features
- Unpaired image-to-image translation using **Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks** (CycleGAN)  
- Converts **horses → zebras** and **zebras → horses**  
- Based on **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** with cycle-consistency loss  
- PyTorch implementation (modular and extendable)  
- Support for training from scratch or using pre-trained weights
